            Although I do not have formal job experience, I have built several real-world projects and completed multiple certifications. These include:
            <br />
            - <strong>UI/UX Design</strong> from Great Learning Academy<br />
            - <strong>JavaScript Essentials 1 & 2</strong> from Cisco Networking Academy
            <br /><br />
            These certifications included hands-on projects and simulations that sharpened my problem-solving, design thinking, and coding skills. I regularly work with tools like <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>Redux Toolkit</strong> to deepen my development expertise.
